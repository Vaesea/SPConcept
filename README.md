# Temporary Title
This is a concept for VS Dave And Bambi: Steel Paperclip Edition. Temporary Title is not it's title.

## How To Compile
These are the versions of the things I use. You may be able to install later or earlier versions of these, however, I wouldn't recommend it
1. Install Haxe 4.3.0
2. Open the terminal and enter these commands:

haxelib install lime 8.1.2

haxelib install openfl 9.3.3

haxelib install flixel 5.6.1

haxelib install flixel-addons 3.2.2 (Not used right now, will be in the future)

haxelib install flixel-tools 1.5.1 (Not sure what this is used for, but the haxeflixel website says you should install it, and I have it installed, so you should probably install it)

haxelib run lime setup (Needed for you to use the lime test / build windows command)

3. Now, open a terminal and build the game using one of these commands:

lime test windows -debug (builds it as a debug build)

lime build windows -release (builds it as a release build)

## How To Play Without Compiling
You can play by going to the GitHub Actions page for this repository, or, when this gets included in VDAB: Steel Paperclip Edition, I'll likely do one of these things:
1. Make it so you need to press 2 on the Main Menu to go to this game.
2. Make it so when you press 7 in a Bambi song, you get brought to this game.
